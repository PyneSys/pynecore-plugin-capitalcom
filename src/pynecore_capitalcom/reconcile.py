"""Snapshot reconcile + missing-pending tracker + unexpected-cancel raiser.

The plugin's poll cycle reads ``GET /positions`` + ``GET /workingorders``
and reconciles them against the BrokerStore — the runtime equivalent of
``_recover_in_flight_submissions`` (which only runs at restart). Splits
into:

* ``_reconcile_snapshot`` — the workhorse. Walks every live position +
  working order, resolves bracket leg dispositions, emits partial-fill
  events, retires confirmed siblings on mixed-bracket rejection,
  handles natural-close detection, and writes resolution markers for
  ambiguous cases.
* ``_missing_pending_tracker`` — separately tracks bot-owned rows that
  vanish without a corresponding cancel event; stamps
  ``missing_pending_since`` so a grace window must elapse before
  raising.
* ``_maybe_raise_unexpected_cancel`` — applies the configured policy
  (stop / stop_and_cancel / re_place / ignore) when the grace window
  expires. ``stop`` raises :class:`UnexpectedCancelError`; the rest
  are quieter outcomes.

State touched: BrokerStore through ``self.store_ctx``,
``_current_poll_id`` (read).
